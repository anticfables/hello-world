# hello-world
Why hello there. I'm a motion graphics and interactive designer/developer.
Originally having learned to code in Flash/Actionscript, now I am in the process of adjusting to the brave new post-Flash world by learning JavaScript, a bit of C#, and now some Ruby. I've also done a bit of dabbling in PHP.
